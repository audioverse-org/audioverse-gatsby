Or, perhaps, we think that the small things we do don&rsquo;t really matter that much. In this episode of the GYC Beyond Podcast Esther Louw interviews Tara Vang as she shares a powerful testimony of God&rsquo;s faithfulness and ability to use even the smallest things to make an eternal impact. Tara is the vice president of evangelism for GYC and also serves as the GLOW Project Manager at the Pacific Union Conference.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
