The Lord blessed him to clearly summarize the purpose of our ministry and the predicament of our Lord.  Closure for Jesus is a ministry focused on helping men and women understand the cost of our salvation.  Jesus is still longing to bring sin to an end, and could if we would understandingly and lovingly cooperate with Him.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
