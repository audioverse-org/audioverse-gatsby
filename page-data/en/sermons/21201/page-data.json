These people have an urgent need for the abundant life that is only found in a vibrant relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n<p>The real question we want to answer is how? How do we do evangelism in a world where social scientists tell us we are now living an un-Christian and un-churched culture, a world where people do not see any relevance in Christianity or in attending church?</p>\r\n<p>Our objective in our breakout session is to show you how you can reach this world, where people definitely have a need for the life-giving message of the gospel, although they may not see their need. We are going to look at how you can bring people to Christ right where you are.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, whether you are a carpenter, a physician, a mechanic, hairdresser, chef, waitress or a student, God is calling you to reach lost and lonely people with the life-giving message of God&rsquo;s love.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
