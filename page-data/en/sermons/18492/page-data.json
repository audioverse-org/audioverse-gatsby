This session provides guidance on how we can relate to and tap into these differences for the benefit of our organizations, causes, and missions. Practical examples, Q/A and discussion will be included. Let&rsquo;s make the most of these wonderful differences which God created!&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
