For more than 150 years, we have preached, &ldquo;Jesus is coming soon.&rdquo;&nbsp;Generations of Adventists have gone to their graves believing Jesus would come in their lifetimes. How can we&nbsp;keep the hope of the Advent burning alive in our hearts in light of our Lord&rsquo;s delayed return? Are we dependent&nbsp;on the uncertainty of world events to motivate us, or is there something much stronger that will be the impetus&nbsp;for God&rsquo;s people to passionately share Christ&rsquo;s last-day message with the world?</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
