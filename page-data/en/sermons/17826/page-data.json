Trapped in a cycle of trying to find fulfillment in the idea of being loved, the single woman often resorts to accepting and settling into feelings of worthlessness, abandonment or unloveliness as a norm. This session aims to break through those emotional misconceptions, and provide tools for women to find the truest sense of freedom and ultimate satisfaction in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
