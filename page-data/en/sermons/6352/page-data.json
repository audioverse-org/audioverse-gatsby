What does the Bible say about addiction? And how does God heal hearts&nbsp;devastated by abuse? Is there such a thing as biblical counseling&mdash;or must we refer people to humanistic&nbsp;psychologists to solve emotional brokenness? We talk much about God&rsquo;s design for physical health, but&nbsp;healthy bodies often only conceal shattered hearts. God&rsquo;s greatest desire is not that we merely have healthy&nbsp;bodies, but that we be transformed by the renewing of our minds (Romans 12:2).

God wants to use you to set captives free!</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
