They say they both can&rsquo;t exist in the Christian&rsquo;s life. One has to go, and the one that is usually set aside is the law. But hold on minute. Is it possible to abrogate God&rsquo;s law for the sake of grace? What do Jesus and the New Testament writers say about their relationship? Is grace needed because God&rsquo;s law cannot be changed? Find out the answers to these questions and more in this crucial message by Pastor Chris Buttery.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
