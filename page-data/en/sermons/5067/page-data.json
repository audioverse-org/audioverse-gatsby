It will also show how the collaborative effort of physicians, nutritionists,&nbsp;lay pastors, vegan cooks, musicians, and Bible workers helped to expand this small Bible study into a major&nbsp;evangelistic series. Dr. Lawrence will also share practical tools used in the office to meet the physical and&nbsp;spiritual needs of his patients, and how that eventually led to several baptisms.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
