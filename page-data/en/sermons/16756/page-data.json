It is good enough to remind humans of how evil, wicked, sinful-how selfish- our fallen natures are. Therefore, we need a Savior. I need a Savior. You need a Savior. The political election in the United States reminds us that we all need a Savior. Every political leader in this world, no matter how good or bad, needs a Savior. And understanding the coroporate-ness of our fallen humanity leads Christians to pray for all mankind. Which then begs the question- Have you prayed for the president?</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
