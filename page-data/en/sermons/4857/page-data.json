They impact not only our lives but others&rsquo; as well. As Christ interacted with Mary at Simon&rsquo;s house, we must learn from Him to act in God&rsquo;s way of love, grace, and mercy. We need to be sensitive to others&rsquo; forgiven lives and walk as a forgiven/restored Christian ourselves.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
