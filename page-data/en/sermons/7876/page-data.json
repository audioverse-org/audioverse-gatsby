We are also known for promoting a message of health and healing that is centered on making consistent wholesome lifestyle choices. It is vitally important we are as careful in teaching accurate health principles as we are in Bible interpretation. Do we proclaim a health message that is consistent with inspired writing and is evidence-based? If we don&rsquo;t, then for many we undermine their confidence in our interpretation of the Bible. This seminar will explore in practical ways the challenge of finding balance in the principles of health we communicate to those around us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
