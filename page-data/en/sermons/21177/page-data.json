In fact, the greater part of our contemporary society today does not even believe in absolute truth. A modern-day disciple of Christ out of touch with this culture is like an uninformed missionary trying to teach in a foreign country. To share God&rsquo;s Word effectively in the twenty-first century, soul-winners need to know how to connect with and confront a society of postmodern thinkers. In this seminar, Pastor Christian Martin shows how we can reach the present age with the everlasting gospel.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
