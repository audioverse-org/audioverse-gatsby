Paul&rsquo;s distraught testimony of doing what he didn&rsquo;t want to do and finding himself unable to do what he wanted has resonated with many Christians. But is this God&rsquo;s ultimate will for our lives? In this sermon Pastor Clark explores Romans 7 in the context of Romans 6 and 8, and uncovers the promises of victory in Jesus hidden in this passage.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is another in our series on the Book of Romans (chapter 7).</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
