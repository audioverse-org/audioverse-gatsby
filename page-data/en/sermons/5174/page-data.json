But the Bible writers, such as the Psalmist, seemed to have seen it quite differently! Why would they have longingly anticipated, welcomed, and even prayed for that which many Christians today quite dread? In this sermon we will discover the answer &ndash; and when we do we&rsquo;ll join David in pleading with God to &ldquo;Arise, O God, judge the earth.&rdquo; Psalm 82:8.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
