Not at all flattering. &nbsp;Yet, it has been 176 years since Jesus transferred from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place and all we&rsquo;ve managed as a church during all that time is to replicate ourselves over and over and over again. More and more lukewarm, self-righteous Laodiceans. Why? Because we don&rsquo;t understand Christ&rsquo;s purpose in giving us the three Angel&rsquo;s messages.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
