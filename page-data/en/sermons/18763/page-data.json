Explore leadership responsibilities of a Seventh-day Adventist health professional that extend beyond the practice into the local church and community in areas of healthful practices and spiritual advancement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Demonstrate the differences among, and relative importance of, your private health practice, public health education, traditional evangelism, and health evangelism in advancing God's church in this world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Recognize your responsibility to select, critique, modify, lead, and monitor health evangelism programming conducted in your practice, the local church, and the community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Health evangelism today is mostly hodgepodge of unsystematic efforts performed by loving, dedicated, Christian, professionals. Clarity in Health Evangelism is badly needed, but requires an understanding of what must be primary, what is secondary and what is tertiary in its organization and implementation. Health Evangelism in every conceivable setting. His lifetime of experience will help you see the trees and the forest.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
