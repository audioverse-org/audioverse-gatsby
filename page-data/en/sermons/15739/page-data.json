Yet, the Spirit of Prophecy tells us not only to reach them but to make them our first evangelistic priority. Sharing Christ with this group, however, can feel intimidating and even hopeless. Traditional methods tend not to work well with W3s. There is, however, a way! In this seminar, David, will describe an effective and easy approach to sharing your faith with even the most Wealthy, Worldly, and Well-Educated people in your sphere of influence.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
