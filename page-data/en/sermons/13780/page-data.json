Still today, God requires unity among His people if we are to really experience His power. Comparing the beautiful sanctuary to the wonder and beauty of the human body, I pointed out that God wants to make an even more beautiful body of His church. Referencing the beautiful Stanborough sanctuary, I reminded the members that the materials had yielded to the craftsmen, urging them to yield their lives to the Lord Jesus and seeking unity to be the beautiful body He has in mind.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
