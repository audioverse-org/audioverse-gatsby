In this seminar, Ron Duffield will discuss Adventist History in light of the message of Righteousness by Faith and how this core message is meant to be the foundational message upon which all other Adventist distinctives are to be built, including the Sanctuary message and the Laodicean message. In this session, we will glean many lessons from our past history that are beneficial today.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
