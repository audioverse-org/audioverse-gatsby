The message of redemptive grace invites post-abortion individuals to acknowledge certain truths:&nbsp;that their lives are intrinsically valuable; that their child, too, was intrinsically valuable; and although what&nbsp;was done cannot be undone, a Savior awaits&mdash;offering forgiveness, hope, and joy inexpressible. Join us as we&nbsp;explore the post-abortion struggle, the need for healing, and the hope of life restored.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
