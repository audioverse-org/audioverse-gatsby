But do we own up to the part we play in the state of our relationship or do we run and hide from the one who loves us most? Sebastien Braxton beautifully presents to us the love relationship between us and God as shown in the Songs of Solomon. A truly heart warming, life changing message.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
