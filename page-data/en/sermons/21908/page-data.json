Pastor Mark Finley shares a sermon message on three financial principles to survive an economic collapse. The banks of Heaven are full and the Bible gives us truth so we can plan for the future. The stock markets might fail, the banks may fail, but  Jesus is a firm foundation for the people of God. The second coming of Christ is near and God wants you ready for what He has planned. What will you do? Watch and listen as Pastor Mark Finley speaks and teaches from the word of God.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
