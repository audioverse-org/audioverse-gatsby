Illustrates the importance of, and ways by which, practitioners can educate patients on the connection between oral health and overall systemic health.</p>\r\n<p>2. Demonstrate effective methods of connecting the practice of dentistry (the oral cavity) with treatment of the patient's total systemic health through oral medicine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Describe how to implement spiritual elements into the dental office environment and practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Engaging and interactive talk about the vital need to wholistically care for dental health patients, spiritually, mentally, and phsyically. Will outline the need to view and interact with patients at a far deeper level than simply completing a root canal on 8 or a crown on 30, but rather view their visits as opportunities to also encourage and provide information to improve their health and life. Reiterate to colleagues how uniquely our scope of practice automatically brings us into a more intimate relationship with patients and teach how to build upon this opportunity in our dialogues with them. Personal cases and stories will be used to emphasize the benefits spiritually, mentally and physically that such a deeper interaction with patients has on not only the patients, but the clinician and staff alike, not to mention the practice overall. Additionally, simple, practical suggestions on how to transition from a dental business into a dental ministry will be suggested to help colleagues engage in such a transition as they are prayerfully inspired.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
