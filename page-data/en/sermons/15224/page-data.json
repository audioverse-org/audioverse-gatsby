This often leads to the creation of ministries/organizations that are not managed by the Church but share the common purpose of preaching the Gospel in deed and word. God&acute;s purpose for His Church is that all may be united in ministry, recognizing the diversity of talents but united in Spirit, ministry and purpose. Come and be part of a seminar where principles, testimonies and practical clues will be presented to help you respond to God&acute;s calling and work in unity with the Church.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
