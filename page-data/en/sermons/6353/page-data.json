History reveals leaders who were very skilled, but whose outcomes were terrible. Lucifer was one of&nbsp;the greatest experts in technique, but few would call him a great leader. On the other hand, Jesus not only was&nbsp;amazingly competent, but also was known by countless millions as the greatest of all leaders. We will take a&nbsp;look at biblical principles of leadership that build on the Master&rsquo;s foundation.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
