Identify the significant role spiritual care plays in healthcare. 2. Describe the importance of having &lsquo;Christ In You&rsquo; and how our personal relationship with Jesus is the foundation to effectively engage in whole-person care. 3. Demonstrate how adding a spiritual component to your practice leads to improved physical outcomes. 4. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Inspire attendees to live a life committed to reflecting 'Christ in You' on a daily basis as they care for their patients physically, mentally, and spiritually. Many of our family members, our patients, and our colleagues feel an emptiness, and whether they know it or not, this can only be filled by Christ. We will look at Philippians 2 and identify with Christ as we 'let this mind be in you'. We will apply this and other passages to our calling as healthcare workers and as Adventist believers who are anticipating Christ's soon return.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
