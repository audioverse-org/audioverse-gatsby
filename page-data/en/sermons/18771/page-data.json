List five simple ways a person could enhance the blood-pressure-lowering potential of his/her environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Enumerate at least three simple strategies to deal with noise pollution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Describe how social connectedness impacts one's ability to deal with life's stressors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. Summarize salient aspects of the medical literature dealing with the impact of spiritual factors on blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Blood pressure is incredibly responsive to lifestyle and other natural strategies. Although the importance of diet and exercise is often stressed in this context, many clinicians underappreciate the role of the environment factors. In this presentation we will look broadly at environment and blood pressure. We will cover a host of practical factors that encompass not only the physical environment but also look at important issues often omitted from \"environmental\" discussions including mental, social, and spiritual factors.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
