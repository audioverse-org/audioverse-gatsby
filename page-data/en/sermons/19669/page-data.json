He provides practical advice on how to hear and respond to the callings of the Holy Spirit and how to find the balance between taking risks in ministry while being wise and counting the cost. Gary shares frankly from his own experience as a young person as well as from his years of work in ministry. As the world youth director, he provides relevant and up-to-date information on opportunities that are available for young people to become rightly trained and to live a life in active, aggressive and unstoppable ministry for Christ.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://youth.adventist.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://youth.adventist.org</a></div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.learnandsharepodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.learnandsharepodcast.com</a>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
