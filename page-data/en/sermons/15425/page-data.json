Neither word feels comfortable. No one wants to be considered a sinner and who feels worthy of being called a saint? What do theses terms mean, and how can having a proper understanding of these truths bring a new and dynamic dimension to our walk with God? Find out the answer to these questions and more in this weeks presentation with Pastor Chris Buttery.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
