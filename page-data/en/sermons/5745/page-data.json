To make matters abundantly clear he contrasts vividly the difference between a life lived walking after the &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; and a life lived by the power of the Spirit. Join Pastor Clark in this exploration of Romans 8, and be inspired by the wonderful privileges afforded us by the gospel!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is a continuation of our series studying the book of Romans.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
