Whilst they would not be counted as martyrs, many lived such a life of sacrifice and hardship that an early death was arguably inevitable. Some were in their teengage years, others in their twenties and some older but they were all united by their love for Jesus and sharing the message of God's love to the world.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
