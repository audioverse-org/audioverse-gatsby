Dr. Marcum will share concepts from his recently released seven-week Bible study entitled \"Biblical Prescriptions for Life,\" which offers a biblical approach to improving health and prioritizes a restorative relationship with Christ. Join Dr. Marcum on this journey following Christ's example of caring for physical needs and pointing the sick towards the Father.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
