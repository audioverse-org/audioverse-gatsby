In this seminar, Ron Duffield discusses how the Lord desired to&nbsp;return soon after 1844, how He began to send the latter rain, and how He gave the loud cry in 1888. Although&nbsp;the proclamation of this message around the country brought about resistance in many people, positive results&nbsp;still took place. In this session, we will glean many lessons from our past history that are beneficial today.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
