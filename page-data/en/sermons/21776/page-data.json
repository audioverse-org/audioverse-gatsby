The Bible speaks of a time when sin and sadness will be no more. A place where disaster and disappointment have gone ( Heaven ). Is there an hope of us reaching this place? Jesus spoke about it and the disciples believed in it so much they gave their life with hope. Christ has promised never to leave us or forsake us. He cares for His own. One day Jesus will return at the second coming and all of life's trials will fade into insignificance in the light of His glory.
