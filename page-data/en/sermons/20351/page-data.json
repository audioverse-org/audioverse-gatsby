Part of the problem is that we just don&rsquo;t know what to do with them. Using unhealthy strategies can sabotage our relationships, job and even our health. Rather than just reacting to your emotions (as Satan tempts you to do), we can deal with them effectively by relying on the Holy Spirit and applying the Bible which gives us insight and skills on handling our emotions.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
