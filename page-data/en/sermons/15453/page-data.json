Some people know they have them and others don&rsquo;t. Once you define the life commandments you live by and focus on making them a priority in your life, your life will be much richer and fuller. You will be more productive and live a much more balanced life. In this seminar I will share the three life commandments that guide my daily decisions, influence my actions and impact my entire life. Each participant will receive my &ldquo;Life Commandment&rdquo; inventory analysis to help you define and craft your own &ldquo;Life Commandments&rdquo; so you can live the abundant life that Christ Himself offers.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 13\">\r\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"column\">\r\n<p>Objectives:</p>\r\n<p>1.
