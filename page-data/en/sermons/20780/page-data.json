Discuss the treatment benefit of lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise, water, sunshine, temperance, air, and rest as measured in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY&rsquo;s). 2. Show how the typical approach to lifestyle interventions fails at securing the maximum treatment benefit as measured in QALY&rsquo;s. 3. Discover a Biblical approach to lifestyle interventions that secures the maximum treatment benefit as measured in QALY&rsquo;s. 4. Encourage participants to apply this Biblical approach in the treatment of their patients, regardless of their practice setting.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
