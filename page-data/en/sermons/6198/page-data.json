We are living in a time when our greatest need, I believe, is for a praying man. We have plenty of educated men. We have plenty of wealthy men. We have plenty of influential men. We have plenty of musical men. But there is a man that is often underestimated and under appreciated. The man of all men who yields greater power and greater results than all the educated, wealthy, influential, and musical men combined. That is a praying man.\"</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
