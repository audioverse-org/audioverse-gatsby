Or have you committed yourself to follow and serve Him? Many have made a decision to believe in Jesus without making a commitment to follow Him. Biblical belief is more than intellectual acceptance or verbal acknowledgement of Biblical truth. God and our communities are looking to see how His words and truth are lived in our lives. </p>\r\n<p>Knowing that each of us has God-given gifts that are valuable and needed in the body of Christ gives us purpose in God&rsquo;s kingdom. As we demonstrate the love of God through the gifts He gives us, we can experience personal fulfillment and great joy; we can experience purpose in life &ndash; and that is to praise Him. </p>\r\n<p>God wants to use you! He has chosen you for the purpose of doing great things for Him. In Ephesians 2:10 it says, &ldquo;For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.&ldquo; God already has plans for you. He wants you to listen to His calling and make yourself available to serve. Not only that, He expects you to use the gifts He has given you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
