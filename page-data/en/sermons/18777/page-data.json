The need for healing through prayer is great because vast is the multitude of diseased souls. This session emphasizes on the real need of prayer within the hospital setting and various practical ways to implement prayer in your practice and everyday life. We will also be highlighting that reliance of healing for the ill is solely upon the unseen power of God rather than man.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
