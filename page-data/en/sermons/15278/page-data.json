Interestingly, little did he know that his life would change forever while sitting in a pizza parlor one day. At the age of 20, he learned that absolute truth must exist which led to a search for truth--for God. An avid novel writer, God had other plans for him. Cliff now writes for Jesus.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
