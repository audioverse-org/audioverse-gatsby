Paul was the one who said that Christ was living in him, yet he was subject to many trials. If Christ abides in us, why are we suffering like this? Why does it seem temptations come to us even more? When Christ abides in us, what is the true purpose of trials? What will be our response when we are faced with the storms of life? You will explore the answers to these important questions in this session.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
