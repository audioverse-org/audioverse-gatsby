He was an Atheist that providentially started reading the Bible. For 5 years he accumulated many questions, and he started getting answers as he met someone that challenged him in a Christlike manner with the Bible. After much study he fell in love with the author of the Bible and now is not ashamed to share the answers he has found in God's Word.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
