The waves will roar. The winds will be fierce and we will wonder if we have the strength to make it through. Often storms surprise us with their suddenness. We have no choice when the storm will come, its intensity or its duration. We do have a choice of whether we focus on the storm or on the Master of the sea and sky. Christ is with us in every storm and reaches out His strong hand to lift us above the waves and take us from the stormy seas of life to eternity&rsquo;s sea of glass .</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
