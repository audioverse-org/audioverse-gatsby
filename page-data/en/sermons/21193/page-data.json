They didn't know they were dead, but you knew. How did you know? What influenced your thinking? In this seminar, we will be discussing what causes this death and how God can use you to bring it back to life again. Caution, this presentation will probably offend you or it might convict you. Either way, you will hear straight talk on this issue utilizing group discussions, stories, and principles learned over 20 years in ministry.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
