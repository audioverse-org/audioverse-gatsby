Why did Jesus wait two days where he was before going to the aid of his friend? Does God perhaps know something beyond what we know, and see things that we can&rsquo;t see? In this short sermon Pastor Clark explains how God&rsquo;s view is not finite, but infinite, and he always takes the Long View of Love.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
