Often when returning home, you get so overwhelmed with the urgent tasks before you that the tyranny of the urgent crowds out the ability to truly minister to your patients. Pastor Finley will inspire you to go forth with a passion to focus on Christ&rsquo;s ministry. The goal is not to do your best, but to focus on His best; through His righteousness, His grace, and His ability, His best becomes your best. We must rely on His willingness &amp; His power as only that will lead to eternal transformation in ourselves and our patients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
