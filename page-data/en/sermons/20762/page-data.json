Expectations and reputations are always on the line. Pressing demands and the tyranny of the &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; drive our schedules. Yet in life's chaos, the question always lingers in our hearts: Is His purpose being fulfilled in my life? True service for God can only be experienced through true surrender to God. Otherwise, we are only deceiving ourselves while serving ourselves. Christ in us becomes a most joyful experience as we lay everything on the altar...everything. Is your heart surrendered today? Priorities will always speak the truth.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
