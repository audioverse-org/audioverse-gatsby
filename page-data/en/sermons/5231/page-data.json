God hates those things that cause His children pain, separate them from Him, and disrupt the unselfish peace of His universe.&nbsp; The problem is that we as humans often hate what He loves, and love what He hates! In this sermon we explore what it is that God hates &ndash; and how we can be more like Him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is the second in our series on the Book of Romans.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
