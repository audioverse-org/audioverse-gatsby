Each temple became progressively greater in some way. The purpose of each temple was for God to dwell among His people. In each case God's glory was manifested, be it in the glory-filled cloud, the presence of Jesus, or the Holy Spirit in the heart. When the glory came the first time, Moses had to stay out of the temple. When it came the second time, the priests could no longer be in the temple. When Jesus came He chased the money changers out of the temple. In the temple of the heart, self must stay out. I had been invited to do a week of prayer for the week immediately preceding the return of the Stanborough Park members to their newly refurbished sanctuary, and was led to prepare and share this series on what God wants to do in the hearts of His people to make a beautiful church.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
