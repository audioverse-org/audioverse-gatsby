We will probe such questions as, Is the authority of the Scripture absolute? How does one harmonize individual conscience with the authority of Scripture? How can we apply the role of Scripture in our personal lives? We will also carefully examine one of Satan's most subtle last-day strategies to undermine the authority of Scripture and erode confidence in the Word of God. This seminar will provide you with practical principles to discern deceptions and understand scriptural truth.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
