It has valuable information from the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy to find the holistic meaning of Seventh-day Adventist Christian stewardship. Also, it touches general misconceptions about money and possessions in the Christian world: Is money itself evil? Do I have to pay taxes? Is retirement a lack of faith? Practical application of Christian finance principles.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
