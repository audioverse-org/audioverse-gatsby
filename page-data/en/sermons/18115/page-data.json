Perhaps you&rsquo;ve asked yourself, is there one truth, many truths, or no truth? What evidence exists to support an absolute truth in Jesus Christ and how can we share our faith in that truth with others? Dr. Bosman is an assistant professor of mathematics at Andrews University and a recent graduate of Rice University as well as Stanford. Join us as we explore the philosophical claims of biblical religion.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
