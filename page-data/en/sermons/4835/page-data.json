How can I study my Bible so that my mind is strengthened and my life changed and prepared to face and overcome temptation? The object of this workshop is to answer these questions practically. By God&rsquo;s grace you will get a fresh love for God&rsquo;s Word, some inspired practical study tools &ndash; and opportunity to put these tools into practice. May this workshop make us all more &ldquo;wise unto salvation.&rdquo; (2 Tim.3:15)</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
