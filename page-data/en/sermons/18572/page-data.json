However, throughout history, the church has not always been welcoming of the arts. As Christians and Seventh-day Adventists, what place do the arts have in the church? How can they be utilized to glorify God?&nbsp;&nbsp;In this episode of the GYC Beyond Podcast, Esther Louw interviews Neale Schofield to address some of these questions. Neale is currently the Manager of Hope Channel New Zealand as well as the previous CEO of Adventist Media Network in Australia.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
