Which do you want first?&rdquo; The problem is that often even the good news that follows is only relatively so; there&rsquo;s a lot of bad news these days.</p>\r\n<p>Some Christians don&rsquo;t want to hear the bad news.&nbsp; They squirm uncomfortably as a pastor points out contemporary sins or Christians&rsquo; shortcomings.&nbsp; But the apostle Paul unambiguously points out the bad news of our condition before turning to the very good news of a Solution.</p>\r\n<p>This is the third study in our series on the Book of Romans.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
