Included will be the United States which has been the champion of liberties, but today there are those Americans, including Christians who are willing to give up personal freedoms for safety, 2) positive Muslim relationships with Christians and Jews during their Golden Age, 3) the relationship of the third angel&rsquo;s message and liberty of conscience, and 4) freedom of conscience in religious liberty will be seen as foundational to all other freedoms.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
