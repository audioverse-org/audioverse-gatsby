The truth is so important that Jesus said that when we know the truth, it will set us free! Yet many of us don&rsquo;t think truths, but rather hold misbeliefs &ndash; about themselves, the world around them, and others. The good news is that Jesus &ndash; who is the Truth &ndash; can and will help us overcome our misbeliefs.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
