One of their primary objectives was to get laws passed requiring strong smell and putrification before burial. They were afraid of being buried alive! In the Bible, however, we discover the amazing truth that being buried alive &ndash; spiritually &ndash; is not something to be feared, but celebrated! This kind of burial isn&rsquo;t cause for fear or sorrow, but for joy and thanksgiving! Join us as we dig deeply into the Word of God to discover these beautiful truths of renewal and regeneration.  This is another in our continuing series of We Believe messages from God&rsquo;s Word.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
