Ever since Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, humanity has been caught in a struggle between good and evil. Unfortunately, choosing Christ isn&rsquo;t quite as simple as we would like it to be. Each of us come to Jesus with unhelpful habits that we&rsquo;ve cultivated and minds that have a bent towards sin. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve been wondering: what are the nuts and bolts of overcoming temptation? Is it possible? Does God want us to be perfect? In this episode of the GYC Beyond Podcast Esther Louw discusses these questions with Andy Im. Andy is currently the Communications Director at Michigan Conference and is on the board of directors for GYC.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
