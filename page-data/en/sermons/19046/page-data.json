But in this generation, same-sex attraction has become a much more public issue. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve got questions related to a gay family member, friend, or yourself. How does being an Adventist impact sexual identity? How can you reach out to a friend who is struggling in this area or bring your own struggle to Jesus? In this episode of the GYC Beyond Podcast Esther Louw and members of Coming Out Ministries unravel some of these sensitive questions in an open and honest dialogue.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
