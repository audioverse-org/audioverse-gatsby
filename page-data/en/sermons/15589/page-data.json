What is humility? Genuine pride can be experienced in sentiments of satisfaction for a job well done or in your children or grandchildren. The pride the Bible warns us of however is very different.

How can a person find the middle of road, and what does any of this have to do with Paul's liberating statement, \"I am what I am by the grace of God\"? Find out in this week's exciting presentation with Pastor Chris Buttery.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
