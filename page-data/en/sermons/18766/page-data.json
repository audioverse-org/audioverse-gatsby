Articulate at least four fundamental aspects of hypertension epidemiology in the United States.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Provide an explanation for the relatively poor compliance with blood pressure management approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Describe a ten-step approach to controlling blood pressure utilizing non-pharmacological strategies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. List three key dietary strategies that can help individuals control blood pressure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>5. Enumerate three common classes of beverages that tend to foster high blood pressure-- along with the mechanisms responsible for their blood-pressure-raising effects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Approximately 90% of Americans are destined to have hypertension, \"the leading risk factor globally for mortality\" according to the WHO. Nonetheless, conflicting guidelines and issues with medication side effects and non-compliance have left many clinicians searching for better strategies. In this presentation we'll cover data supporting optimal guidelines and lifestyle and strategies for non-pharmacologic blood pressure optimization, suitable for clinical practices and church-based health ministry.&nbsp;</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
