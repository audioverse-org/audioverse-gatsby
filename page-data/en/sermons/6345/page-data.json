Who we are, what&nbsp;we do, and how we do it sends a message far louder than our words. These less tangible characteristics, shaped&nbsp;by our personal habits and the organizational culture, often defeat our well-intended efforts to witness. Just&nbsp;how do we achieve a personal character and an organizational culture that will be a witness for the excellent&nbsp;God we serve? This seminar will examine the steps needed to build a culture of excellence, both personally and&nbsp;within an organization. It covers strategies for recognizing and overcoming the seven pitfalls of mediocrity, as&nbsp;well as methods to encourage and cultivate the seven attributes of a culture of excellence. It will equip you to&nbsp;narrow the gap between mediocrity and excellence, making excellence the norm.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
