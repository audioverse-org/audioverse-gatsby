Relationships are at the heart of what matters most to Jesus. Our relationship to Him matters. Our relationship with our family matters. Our relationship with our church family matters. Our relationship with those that do not know Christ matters. In today&rsquo;s message we will explore the three most significant principles in building healthy, Christ-centered relationships for eternity. Think about the relationships that mean the most to you and what you can do to improve them. Pastor Mark Finley</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
