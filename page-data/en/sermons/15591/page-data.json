Can a person have genuine faith despite their actions? On the other hand, doesn't Scripture constantly call us to obedience to God? And doesn't it consistently teach that we are judged by our works? What does God really want of us - believing or doing? Does He want both? How do we understand the relationship between faith and works? Find out in this vital message with Pastor Chris Buttery.</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
