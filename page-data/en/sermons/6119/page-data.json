If this old adage is true, then why did Jesus promise the disciples power? What was the purpose of power in the movement of Christianity? This sermon explores further the topic of the Holy Spirit and the purpose of the power He bestows upon the church. &nbsp;There is a purpose for the power that the Spirit gives. Without our commitment to that purpose, no power will be given.\"</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
