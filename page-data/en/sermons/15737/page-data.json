We see signs all around us that scream that the apocalypse is near, yet there is the one sign that remains to be fulfilled: all have not yet heard. In these meetings you will learn how to prepare to be a missionary &ndash; spiritually, intellectually, and chronologically. You will have an opportunity to meet missionaries who have served for a few weeks, a year, and longer. God is calling for young people to go the uttermost parts of the world to hasten the coming of Jesus. Come and see &ndash; then go!</p>"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
